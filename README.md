# Tailwind CSS Configuration Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Tailwind CSS configuration:  incorrectly or missingly configured `content` paths within the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## The Problem

The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` tells Tailwind CSS where to find the class names used in your project. If this array is missing or incorrectly specified, Tailwind won't be able to process your classes, leading to styling issues or classes simply not being applied.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Examine `bug.js` (Tailwind config file with missing or improperly configured `content` array)
3. Run your project; you will likely observe that the classes aren't applied correctly or Tailwind throws an error.

## The Solution

Examine `bugSolution.js`.  The correct `content` array has been added to include all necessary source files (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.html`).  Make sure to adapt the paths to match your project structure.
