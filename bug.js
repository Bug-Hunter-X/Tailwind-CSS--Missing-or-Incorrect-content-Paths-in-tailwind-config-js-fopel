```javascript
//Example of a Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js)
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'custom-blue': '#007bff',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
This configuration file is missing the `content` array.  Without the `content` array correctly specifying the files where Tailwind CSS should look for class names, Tailwind won't process any classes. This might lead to classes not being compiled or to unexpected styling behaviors.

Another common error is incorrectly specifying the paths in the `content` array, for example:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html'], // Only specifies index.html
  // ...rest of config
}
```
If your project has components in subdirectories, you'll need to include those subdirectories.  This can be done using glob patterns to make it easier to handle many files or directories.
